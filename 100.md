    We are used to the idea of aging in ourselves. We are so used to this that it comes as a surprise to find that there may be some animals that do not age. Sea anemones(海葵) are an example. Some have been kept for nearly a century without showing any signs of lifelessness. Some kinds of sea worms can even “grow backwards.” If kept in the dark and given nothing to eat, they get steadily smaller, They finally end as a ball of cells(细胞) looking rather like the egg from which they came. Under good conditions the ball will turn back to a worm and start growing again. One could probably keep them growing and un-growing again and again.

    When we see well, we do not think about our eyes very often. It is only when we cannot see perfectly that we realize how important our eyes are.
    People who are near-sighted can only see things that are very close to their eyes, Everything else seems blurry(=unclear). Many people who do a lot of work, such as writing, reading and sewing become near—sighted. Then
    People who are far-sighted suffer from just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty in reading a book unless they hold it at arm’s length. If they want to do much reading ,they must get glasses, too.
    Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. They have what is called astigmatism (散光). This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people’s eyes become cloudy because of cataracts (白内障). Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them.
    Having two good eyes is important for judging distances. Each eye sees things from a slightly different angle (角度). To prove this to yourself, look at an object our of one eye; then look at the same object out of your other eye. You will find the object’s relation to the background and other things around it has changed. The difference between these two different eye views helps us to judge how far away an object is. People who have only one eye cannot judge distance as people with two eyes.
1. We should take good care of our eyes     .
   A. only when we can see well
   B. only when we cannot see perfectly
   C. even if we can see well
   D. only when we realize how important our eyes are
2. When things far away seem indistinct(模糊不清) , one is probably     .
   A. near-sighted                    B. far-sighted
   C. astigmatic                      D. suffering from cataracts
3. The underlined word suffer in the third paragraph probably means     .
   A. experience                     B. imagine
   C. feel pain                       D. are affected with
4. Having two eyes instead of one is particularly useful for     .
   A. seeing at night                  B. seeing objects far away

    The most important use of drifting (漂流) bottles is to find ocean currents. When the position and direction of currents are known, ships can use the forward movement of a current or stay away from currents that would carry them off their course. Benjamin Franklin was one of the first to use bottles in the study of currents. He wondered why British mall ships needed a week or two longer than U.S. ships needed in order to cross the Atlantic Ocean. Franklin thought the Gulf Stream (墨西哥湾流) might explain this difference.
    Franklin talked with captains of U.S. ships. He found that they knew each turn of the Gulf Stream. They used the current in every possible way. From his talks with the captains. Franklin made his first map of the Gulf Stream. Then he checked his map by using sealed (密封的) bottles. The map that he finally made is still used, with only a few changes, today.

    The blue eyes that looked at him from outside the door were like the light through a magnifying glass (放大镜) when it is at its brightest and smallest, when paper and leaves begin to smoke.
    “Hey ,” said the man in the door. “Remember me?”
    “Yes,” the boy said, whispering. “Rick.”
    He felt so surprised to see Rick. All of Rick seemed to be shown in the eyes, with a strong feeling that ought to have hurt him
    “You knew me,” Rick said. “You hadn’t forgotten.”
    “You’re ——just the same,” the boy said, and felt much thankful.
    He seemed even to be wearing the same clothes, the same blue shirt and grey trousers. He was thin, but he was built to be lean; and he was still, or again, sunburnt (晒黑了). After everything, the slow white smile still showed the slight feeling of happiness.
    “Let’s look at you,” Rick said, dropping into a chair. Then slowly he felt more at home, and he became once more just Rick, as if nothing had happened. There were lines about his eyes, and deeper lines on his cheeks (面颊), but he looked like——just Rick, lined by sunlight and smiling.
    “When I look at you,” he said, “You make me think about me, for we look like each other.”

    Can trees talk? Yes, but not in words. Scientists have reason to believe that trees do communicate (交际) with each other. Not long ago, researchers learned some surprising things. First a willow tree attacked in the woods by caterpillars (毛虫) changed the chemistry of its leaves and made them taste so terrible that they got tired of the leaves and stopped eating them. Then even more astonishing, the tree sent out a special smell---a signal (信号) causing its neighbors to change the chemistry of their own leaves and make them less tasty.
    Communication, of course, doesn’t need to be in words. We can talk to each other by smiling, raising our shoulders and moving our hands. We know that birds and animals use a whole vocabulary of songs, sounds, and movements. Bees dance their signals, flying in certain patterns that tell other bees where to find nectar (花蜜) for honey. So why shouldn’t trees have ways of sending message?
1. It can be concluded from the passage that caterpillars do not feed on leaves that ______.
   A. are lying on the ground                B. have an unpleasant taste
   C. bees don’t like                       D. have an unfamiliar shape
2. The willow tree described in the passage protected itself by ______.
   A. growing more branches                B. communicating with birds and bees
   C. changing its leaf chemistry              D. shaking caterpillars off
3. According to the passage, the willow tree was able to communicate with other trees by ______. 
   A. waving its branches                   B. giving off a special smell
   C. dropping its leaves                    D. changing the colour of its trunk
4. According to this passage, bees communicate by ______.

    In a very real sense, people who have read good literature have lived more than people who cannot or will not read. To have read Gulliver’s Travels is to have had the experience of listening to Jonathan Swift, of learning about man’s inhumanity (残酷) to man. To read Huckleberry Finn is to feel what it is like to drift (漂流) down the Mississippi River on a raft (木排). To have read Byron is to have suffered his rebellions with him and to have enjoyed his nose—thumbing at (对……的蔑视) society. To have read Native Son is to know how it feels to be frustrated (受挫折) in the particular way in which Blacks in Chicago are frustrated. This is effective communication (交流). It enables us to feel how others felt about life, even if they lived thousands of miles away and centuries age. It is not true that “We have only one life to live.” If we read, we can live as many more lives and as many kinds of lives as we wish.

    When I lived in Spain, some Spanish friends of mine decided to visit England by car. Before they left, they asked me for advice about how to find accommodation (住所). I suggested that they should stay at ‘bed and breakfast’ houses, because this kind of accommodation gives a foreign visitor a good chance to speak English with the family. My friends listened to my advice, but they came back with some funny stories.
    “We didn’t stay at bed and breakfast houses,” they said, “because we found that most families were away on holiday.”
    I thought this was strange. Finally I understood what had happened. My friends spoke little English, and they thought ‘VACANCIES’ meant ‘holidays’, because the Spanish word for ‘holidays” is ‘vacaciones’. So they did not go to house where the sign outside said ‘VACANCLES’, which in English means there are free rooms. Then my friends went to house where the sign said ‘NO VACANCLES’, because they thought this meant the people who owned the house were not away on holiday. But they found that these houses were all full. As a result, they stayed at hotels!
    We laughed about this and about mistakes my friends made in reading other signs. In Spanish, the word ‘DIVERSION’ means fun. In English, it means that workmen are repairing the road, and that you must take a different road. When my friends saw the word ‘DIVERSION’ on a road sign, they thought they were going to have fun. Instead, the road ended in a large hold.
    English people have problems too when they learn foreign languages. Once in Paris. when someone offered me some more. coffee, I said ‘Thank you’ in French. I meant that I would like some more, However , to my surprise the coffee pot was taken away! Later I found out that ‘Thank you’ in French means ‘Mo, thank you.’
1. My Spanish friends wanted advice about ______.

    Sam and Joe were astronauts. There was once a very dangerous trip and the more experienced astronauts knew there was only a small chance of coming back alive (活着). Sam and Joe, however, thought it would be exciting though a little dangerous. “we’re the best men for the job,” they said to the boss. “There may be problems, but we can find the answers.” “They’re the last people I’d trust,” thought the boss. “But all the other astronauts have refused to go.”
    Once they were in space, Joe had to go outside to make some repairs. When the repairs were done, he tried to get back inside the spaceship. But the door was locked. He knocked but there was no answer. He knocked again, louder this time, and again no answer came. Then he hit the door as hard as he could and finally a voice said, “Who’s there?” “It’s me! Who else could it be?” shouted Joe. Sam let him in all right but you can imagine that Joe never asked to go on a trip with Sam again!

Instead, she opposed (抗拒) him with courage and at last made him change his mind. Mary Cassatt gave up her social position (社会地位) and all thought of a husband and a family, which in those times was unthinkable for a young lady.

    Douglas Grace talks about his ideal city of the future.
    I see the city of the future in three zones(区域)---inner(内部), middle and outer. In the inner zone there will be no private(私人的) cars. Public transport(交通) will be free and there will only be ambulances(急救车), fire engines, taxis and police cars. This inner zone will be the residential(住宅的) and recreational(娱乐的) area of the city. People will live there and go out to enjoy themselves----to cinemas and restaurants. There will be parks and open spaces, trees and lakes, schools and universities. This way, when people are at home, they can go out easily and safely.
    Just outside the inner zone there will be big car parks for all private cars.
    The banks and most of the shops and hospitals will be in the middle zone. These are things that people don’t need every day.
    All the factories and offices will be in the outer zone. People will travel out of the center to work, and back to the center in the evenings. The inner zone will be cleaner and better to live in and there will be more space for industry on the outside.

    Baths and bothing have long been considered of medical importance to man. In Greece there are the ruins(废墟) of a water system(系统) for baths built over 3,000 years ago. The Romans had warm public baths. In some baths, as many 3,000 persons could bathe at the same time.
    Treating disease by taking bathing has been popular for centuries. Modern medical bathing first became popular in Europe and by the late 1700’s has also become popular in the United States.
    For many years frequent(经常的) bathing was believed to be bad for one’s health. Ordinary bathing just to keep clean was avoided(避免), and perfume was often used to cover up body smells!
    By the 1700’s doctors began to say that soap and water were good for health. They believed that it was good for people to be clean. Slowly, people began to bathe more frequently. During the Victorian Age of the late 19th century, taking a bath on Saturday night became common.
    In the United States ordinary bathing was slow to become popular. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, many Americans were know as “The Great Unwashed!” In one American city , for example, a person was only allowed to take a bathe every thirty days! That was a law!
    Frequency of bathing today is partly a matter of habit. People know that bathing for cleanliness is important to health, Doctors know that dirty bodies increase the chance of diseases. As a result, in the United States, people generally bathe often. Some people bath once a day at least. They consider a daily bath essential (=necessary) to good health.

    Today I’ll be talking about the invention of the camera and photography. The camera is often thought to be a modern invention, but as early as 1727, a German physicist discovered that light darkens silver salt. Used as a camera, a big box was set up, and a small hole was cut in one side to let the light in; he made temporary pictures on the salt. Silver salt is still the base of the photographic film today. Then a French scientist made the first permanent (永久的) picture by using a special piece of metal which was covered with silver salt. A photograph he made in 1826 still exists.
    The painter De Gear improved the process (制作法) by covering the metal also with placing the common salt which we can eat. This was in 1839, the official date of beginning of photographs. But the problem was the printing of the photographs. And it wasn’t until other scientists developed the kind of photographic paper we now use that good prints were possible and photography became truly modern. In the 1870’s, Matthew Bradey was able to take his famous pictures in American Civil War. In the 20’s of this century, Georges Mann of the United States simplified film developing (冲洗), and Dr Edward Lane invented the so—called ‘Instant Camera’ which uses self—developing film. If we say photography came into existence in 1839, it follows that it took more than 100 years for the camera to reach its present condition of technical refinement(密度).
1. What discovery was the basis of photography?
   A. Light darkens silver salt.                     B. Light darkens natural salt.
   C. Light darkens silver.                         D. Light darkens self--developing film
2. How was the first permanent picture made?
   A. By making use of special paper.               B. By adding common salt to silver salt.
   C. By giving a slight colour to the silver salt.       D. By using a special piece of metal.
3. What does the speaker regard as the official date of beginning of photography?
   A. 1727          B. 1826            C. 1839            D. 1870
4. According to the speaker why is Matthew Bradey remembered today?
   A. He was a soldier.                   B. He took war photographs.
   C. He painted portraits.                 D. He designed a portable camera.
5. What did Doctor Edward Lane invent?
   A. A cheap process of developing film at home. 
   B. A new kind of film.
   C. An automatic printer.
   D. An ‘instant camera’ that develops its own film.

    The fiddler crab (蟹) is a living clock. It indicates(=shows) the time of day by the colour of its skin, which is dark by day and pale by night. The crab’s changing colour follows a regular twenty—four hour plan that exactly matches the daily rhythm (节奏) of the sun.
    Does the crab actually keep time, or does its skin simply answer to the sun’s rays, changing colour according to the amount of light strikes it? To find out, biologists kept crabs in a dark room for two months. Even without daylight, the crab’s skin colour continued to change exactly on time.
    This characteristic (特性) probably developed gradually in answer to the daily rising and setting of the sun, to help protect the crab from sunlight and enemies. After millions of years it has become completely regulated (受控制) inside the living body of the crab.
    The biologists noticed that once each day the colour of the fiddler crab is especially dark, and that each day this happens fifty minutes later than on the day before. From this they discovered that each crab follows not only the rhythm of the sun but also that of the tides (潮水). The crab’s period of greatest darkening is exactly the time of low tide on the beach where it was cought!

   A in a regular 24—hour rhythm            B. in answer to the sun’s rays
   C. at low tide                            D. every fifty minutes
2. The crab’s changing colour ______.
   A. tells the crab what time it is        B. protects the crab from the sunlight and enemies
   C. keeps the crab warm              D. is of no real use
3. When the fiddler crabs were kept in the dark , they ______.
   A. did not change colour             B. changed colour more quickly 
   C. changed colour more slowly        D. changed colour on the same timetable
4. The crab’s colour—changing ability was probably developed ______.
   A. in the process of evolution (进化)        B. over millions of years
   C. by the work of biologists               D. both A and B
5. The best title for this selection would be ______.
   A. The Sun and the Tides                      B. Discoveries in Biology

    People used to say, “The hand that rocks (摇) the cradle (摇篮) rules the world.” and “Behind every successful man there is a woman.”
    Both these sayings mean the same thing. Men rule the world, but their mothers and wives rule them..
    Most American women wish to make their husbands and sons successful, but some of them want more for themselves. They want good jobs. When they work they want to be better paid. They want to be as successful as men.
    The American women’s liberation movement was started by women who didn’t want to stand behind successful men. They wanted to stand beside men, with the same chance for success. They refused to work side by side with men who do the same work for a higher pay.
    A liberated woman must be proud of being a woman and have confidence (自信) in herself. If somebody says to her, “You have come a long way, baby.” she will smile and answer, “Not nearly as far as I’m going to go, baby!”

    It must have been around nine O’clock when I drove back home from work because it was already dark. As I came near to the gates I turned off the headlamps of the car so as to prevent the beam(光荣) from swinging(摇摆)in through the window and waking Jack, who shared the house with me.

I was lying on my back reading when I saw it. I knew that moving was out of the question. I couldn’t have moved even if I’d wanted to .” I realized that he was serious. “I was relying on you to call a doctor as soon as you came home.” Jack went on.” It hasn’t bitten me yet but I daren’t do anything to upset it. It might wake up. I’m sick of this,” he said, ：” I took it for granted that you would have come home an hour ago.”

    In earliest times, men considered lightning to be one of the great mysteries (神秘的事物) of nature. Some ancient peoples believed that lightning and thunder were the weapons (武器) of the gods.
    In reality, lightning is a flow of electricity formed high above the earth. A single flash of lightning 1.6 kilometres long has enough electricity to light one million light bulbs (灯泡).
    The American scientist and statesman, Benjamin Franklin, was the first to show the connection between electricity and lightning in 1752. In the same year he also built the first lightning rod (避雷针). This device (装置物) protects buildings from being damaged by lightning.
    Modern science has discovered that one stroke (闪击) of lightning has a voltage (电压) of more than 15 million volts (伏特). A flash of lightning between a cloud and the earth may be as long as 13 kilometers, and travel at a speed of 30 million meters per second.
    Scientists judge that there are about 2,000 million flashes of lightning per year. Lightning hits the Empire State Building in New York City 30 to 48 times a year. In the United States alone it kills an average (平均数) of one person every day.
    The safest place to be in case of an electrical storm is in a closed car. Outside, one should go to low ground and not get under tress. Also, one should stay out of water and away from metal fences. Inside a house, people should avoid open doorways and windows and not touch wires or metal things.
    With lightning, it is better to be safe than sorry?

Later that year he became a star after an eight-minute Mickey Mouse film. The cinema audience liked him because he was lazy and greedy(贪婪的), and because he lost his temper(发脾气) very quickly . And they loved his voice when he became angry with Mickey’s eight nephews(侄子). Soon Donald was more popular than Mickey Mouse himself, probably because he wasn’t a goody-goody like Mickey.
    In the 1930S,’ 40s and ‘50s Donald and hid friends Mickey , Goofy and Pluto made hundreds of Disney cartoons. He also made educational films about the place of the USA in the world, and safety in the home. Then in 1966 Donald Duck and his voice disappeared---there were no more new cartoons. 
    Clarence Nash died in February, 1985. But today’s children can still see the old cartoons on television and hear that famous voice.

    Why do we have in a camera a lens(镜头)instead of a simple hole?
 
    The reason can be seen from the figures(图像).
    In Figure 1, the hole is small. Rays of light from a point (P1)outside reach a very small part of the wall opposite, and we see there a small point. But when the hole is bigger, as in Figure 2, rays from the point(P2)can cover a larger part of the wall opposite, and we don’t see a clear point, Rays from other points(Q) outside can also fall on the same place inside. Therefore the picture is not clear when the hole is big and it is not bright when the hole is small because very very little light can pass through it.. We can get better result with a lens. If the lens is made in the shape shown in Figure 3, all the rays of light from the point(P3) are thrown on point(P’) inside. The picture which we see, therefore, is clear, and it is also bright because more light can pass through a lens than through a small hole.
1. In Figure 1 we see a faint small point on the wall because     .
   A. the point(P1) is very small              B. the hole isn’t big enough
   C. light rays don’t travel in straight lines     D. light rays can’t pass through a small hole
2. Figure 2 shows that the bigger the hole is,     .
   A. the more light can pass through          B. the clearer the picture will be
   C. the better result we will get             D. the faster the light rays travel 
3. From figure 3, we can see a lens     .
   A. can form a clear picture                B. can make light go in a straight line
   C. can help light rays to go faster           D. cannot give the picture more light than in Fig. 2
4. The main idea of the second paragraph of the article is that     .
   A. a smaller hole is better than a bigger one
   B. big holes are better than small ones
   C. both a big hole and a small one have their weak points
   D. light rays are sure to pass through a hole no matter it is big or small
5. Which of the following statements is true?

    Overhead bridges are found in many parts of Beijing, especially in places where traffic is very heavy and crossing the road is dangerous.
    The purpose of these bridges is to enable pedestrians (行人) to cross roads safely. Overhead bridges are used to very much the same way as zebra crossings. They are more efficient (效率高的) although less convenient because people have to climb up a long flight of steps. This is inconvenient especially to older people. When pedestrains use an overhead bridge, they do not hold up traffic. However, when they cross a busy road using a zebra crossing, traffic is held up. This is why the government has built many overhead bridges to help pedestrians and to keep traffic moving at the same time.
    The government of Beijing has spent a large amount of money on building these bridges. For their own safety, pedestrians should be encouraged to use them instead of risking (冒…危险) their lives by dashing across the road. Old people , however , may find it a little difficult climbing up and down the steps, but it is still much safer than walking across the road with all the danger of moving traffic.
    Overhead bridges serve a very useful purpose. Pedestrians, both old and young, should make it a habit to use them. This will prevent unnecessary accidents and loss of life.
1. What is the advantage of overhead bridges mentioned in this passage?
   A. Taller trucks can pass under them.
   B. Pedestrians can climb up and have a view of the city.
   C. They are safer for pedestrians and can keep traffic moving at the same time.
   D. They are easier and more convenient for the pedestrians.
2. Why were overhead bridges built in Beijing?
   A. Because they prevent traffic from being held up.
   B. Because they provide an easy way for the drivers to cross the road.
   C. Because they save money for the government.
   D. Because they save time for the pedestrians.
3. Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?
   A. Overhead bridges are found in every part of Beijing.
   B. Overhead bridges are only found in the centre of Beijing.
   C. Overhead bridges are found in many parts of big cities in China.
   D. Overhead bridges are found in places where traffic is heavy.
4. The underlined words a zebra crossing probably mean ________.

    Man is a land animal, but he is also closely tied to the sea. Throughout history the sea has served the needs of man. The sea has provided man with food and a convenient (便利的) way to travel to many parts of the world. Today, nearly two—thirds of the world’s population live within 80 kilometers of the sea coast.
    In the modern technological world, the sea offers many resources to help mankind survive (=continue to live). Resources on land are beginning to be used up. The sea, however, still can be hoped to supply many of man’s needs.
    The list of riches of the sea yet to be developed by man’s technology is impressive. Oil and gas explorations (探险) have been carried out for nearly 30 years. Valuable amounts of minerals exist on the ocean floor ready to be mined (开采).
    Fish farming promises to be a good way to produce large quantities of food. The culture of fish and shellfish (贝类动物) is an ancient skill practised in the past mainly by Oriental people.
    Besides oil and gas, the sea may offer new sources of energy. Experts believe that the warm temperature of the ocean can be used in a way similar to the steam in a steamship. Ocean currents (水流) and waves offer possible use as a source of energy.
    Technology is enabling man to explore (勘探) ever more deeply under the sea. The development of strong, new materials has made this possible.
    The technology to harvest the sea continues to improve. Experts believe that by the year 2000 the problems that prevent us from exploiting fully the food, minerals, and energy sources of the sea will be largely solved.
1. The major things that the sea offers man are ______.
   A. fish and oil                           B. minerals and oil
   C. warm temperature and ocean currents       D. the food, energy sources, and minerals
2. The sea serves the needs of man because ______.
   A. in provides man with food              B. it offers oil to man
   C. it supplies man with minerals            D. all of the above
3. We can conclude from this passage that ______.
   A. the sea resources have largely been used up
   B. the sea, in the broad sense, has not yet been developed 
   C. the problems that prevent us from using the food, minerals, and energy sources of the 
     sea have already been solved.
   D. by the year 2000 , the technology will be good enough to exploit all the sea resources

    Now and again I have had horrible dreams, but not enough of them to make me lose my delight in dreams. To begin with. I like the idea of dreaming, of going to bed and lying still and then, by some queer magic(神奇的魔力), wandering into another kind of existence. As a child, I could never understand why grown-ups took dreaming so calmly when they could make such a fuss(大惊小怪) about any holiday, This still puzzles me. I am puzzled by people who say they never dream and appear to have no interest in the subject. It is much more astonishing than it would be if they said they never went out for a walk. Most people do not seem to accept dreaming as part of their lives. They appear to see it as an irritating(令人困扰的) little habit, like sneezing or yawning(打哈欠).I can never understand this. My dream life does not seem as important as my waking life because there is far less of it, but to me it is important.

    One morning, when we had been riding on our bikes for five hours, we came to a bridge where the railway crossed a pond(池塘). For 30 feet there was nothing but the widely-spaced wooden sleepers(枕木) under our wheels, and nothing to stop us falling into the steaming pond below if we lost our balance. Right under the bridge lay the body of a dead cow. I watched Mat as he came near to the bridge and rode straight over, without ever, slowing down. I stopped.
    “What’s up?” he cried out from the other side. 
    “I’m not riding over that thing. If I slip, I’ll be in there with that cow,” “There’s nothing to it. I just did it. didn’t I?”
    “You’re stronger and taller. My feet don’t touch the ground. You do it for me!”
    Mat said strength didn’t come into it and rode off. I knew he would give me at least an hour before coming to help. The sun burned my face, sweat ran off my forehead into my eyes and stuck my blouse(女衬衫) to my body. Try myself rather than wait for Mat to help. I rode back to get a good run-up and over I went.

    Judy’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Morris, lived in another city. Judy was their only child and naturally they doted on(溺爱) Judy’s children. They often sent the children presents.
    Last April Mr. Morris died. Now that Mrs. Morris was quite alone, I expected that Judy would want her to come and live with them. One day, Margaret told me grandma was coming to live with them and her daddy and mummy would want my room back. The news didn’t surprise me and the next day I went to Judy and asked her about it. I said I couldn’t think of living in their basement room any longer if it was needed for Mrs. Morris. Judy seemed surprised at first. Then she told me there was no deed for me to move, for they hadn’t yet come to any decision about her mother coming to live with them. “Naturally I’m worried about my mother. She has been in poor health.” She smiled sadly and added. “To be honest, Andrew and my mother have never got on well. We’ll wait a bit and see what happens. Perhaps Moter will be all right living herself, of perhaps they will both change their minds.”
    That was six months ago. During this time I’ve heard that Mrs. Morris has had two illnesses and that her health has got worse. A nursing home was mentioned once but Mrs. Morris refused to go there. So up to now she’s still living alone and I’m still living in the basement room.
1. What is the relationship between the speaker and the Carsons?
   A. He is a brother of Andrew Carson.
   B. He is a close friend of the Carsons.
   C. He is a student of Judy Carson.
   D. He is a student who pays to live and have meals at the Carsons’ house.
2. Why did the speaker expect Mrs. Morris to come to live with her daughter?
   A. Because Mr. Morris was dead.
   B. Because Mrs. Morris suffered from illness.
   C. Because Mrs. Morris lived all by herself.
   D. Because of all the reasons mentioned in A, B and C.
3. Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?

   B. Judy had no brothers or sisters to look after her mother.
   C. Mrs. Morris loved her grandchildren very much.
   D. The Carsons once suggested that Mrs. Morris go to live in a nursing home.
4. Why didn’t Mrs. Morris come to live with her daughter’s family?
   A. Because the speaker lived in the basement room and there was no other room for her to live in.
   B. Because she did not have a good relationship with her son-in-law.
   C. Because she was in rather poor health and could not come.
   D. Because she did not want to leave her own house.

    To discover whether bees can see colors, the following experiment is set up. A table is put in a garden, and on the table is a piece of blue cardboard (硬纸板) with a drop of syrup (糖浆) on it. After a short time, bees come to the syrup. The bees then fly to their hive (蜂蜜) and give the syrup to other bees in the hive. Then they return to the feeding-place which they have discovered. After a while, the blue cardboard with the syrup on it is taken away. Instead of this card, a blue card is now put on the left side of the first feeding-place and a red card to its right. These new cards have no syrup on them. Thus, the blue card is on the left, the red card on the right, and there is nothing where the first blue feeding-card used to be. Very soon bees arrive again, and fly straight to the blue card. None go to the red card.
1. To do the experiment, altogether how many cards do you need to prepare?
   A. Two, one blue and one red.                B. Three, two blue and one red.
   C. Three, one blue and two red.               D. Four, two blue and two red.
2. If figure 1 (图1) below shows the table top during step 1 of the experiment, which picture in
   figure 2 represents (代表) step 2?
    (blue card with syrup      blue card      red card   )
     
3. During step 2 of the experiment, the bees come to ______.
   A. the original (原来的)blue card with syrup on it.
   B. the new blue card with no syrup on it.
   C. the empty space where the original blue card was.
   D. the new blue card with syrup on it.
4. The experiment has proved that bees ______.
   A. cannot see colors.                   B. can see colors.

Benin
    Benin is one of the smallest African states. It lies in West Africa on the Gulf (海湾) of Guinea, to the south of Burkina Faso and Niger, between Togo on the west and Nigeria on the east.
    Benin used to be called Dahomey and was controlled and ruled by France from 1893 to 1960, when it became independent (独立). In 1963 the army general Soglo overthrew (推翻) the first president. Maga. Soglo set up an army government and called himself head of state in 1965, but was overthrown and replaced (取代) by a civilian (非军人) government in 1967. In December 1969 Benin had another change of power with the army again taking over (接管). In May 1970, Maga and two other men set up a new government, with each of them acting as president in turn for two years. However, half a year after Maga turned over power to the second man Ahomadegbe, the three-man government was overthrown by the army once more and General Kerekou became president. In November 1975 Kerekou changed the name of the nation from Dahomey to Benin, Benin being the name of a 17th century kingdom covering the same place. Kerekou also announced that Benin would be a People’s Republic based on Marxism-leninism.

    Have you eaten too much over the holidays? You should try fidgeting for a while. Those around you might not like it, but scratching (moving your nails (指甲) against a part of your body) and twitching (moving suddenly and quickly when you don’ t want to) is an important way of burning up calories (卡路里).
    American researchers have found that some people’s squirming (continuously turn your body when nervous) and wigging (move in small movements, especially from side to side) equals (等于) several miles of slow running each day.
    The scientists, based at the National Institute of Health’s laboratory in Phenix, Arizona, are studying why some people get fat and other stay slim.
    In one study 177 people each spent 24 hours in a room in the institute where the amount (量) of energy is measured by their oxygen and carbon dioxide (二氧化碳) levels. By the end of the day, some people had burned up 800 calories in toe-tapping, (moving the front part of your foot up and down) finger-drumming (hitting your fingers continuously and lightly against something hard) and other nervous habits. However, others had burned up only 100 calories.
    The researchers found that slim women fidget more than fat women, but there was no significant difference in men. Heavy people burn up more energy when they fidget than do thin people.

    The 17th-century Irish farmer Rober Cook was the most unusual person in County Waterford. he always wore white linen.

    He warned Maureen Harkavy, “Put that cigarette out, or I’ll land the plane and have you arrested.”
    Maureen, 47, was so shocked she wrote to the airline’s chairman. But his reply was even ruder.

    Maureen and her husband Michael were moved to Paramount flight just before they left Portugal. But they were not told of the company’ s (公司的) no smoking policy.
    (d) “He was loud and rude,” said Maureen. “He said if I lit another cigarette he would land the plane at Bordeaux and hand me to the French police.”

While fellow students are out with their friends, he keeps in touch with his business office in Lancashire by movable phone. Before he set up the company he spent one holiday preparing a plan that would persuade his bank to lend him money.
    “Most students work hard for a good degree because they believe that will help them get a job to support themselves,” he says “I work hard at my company, because that is what will support me next year, after I leave college.”

    I found out one time that doing a favor for someone could get you into a lot of trouble. I was in the eighth grade at the time, and we were having a final test. During the test, the girl sitting next to me whispered something, but I didn’t understand. So I leaned over her way and found out that she was trying to ask me if I had an extra pen. She showed me that hers was out of ink and would not write. I happened to have an extra one, so I took it out of my pocket and put it on her desk.
    Later, after the test papers had been turned in, the teacher asked me to stay in the room when all the other students were dismissed. As soon as we were alone she began to talk to me about what it meant to grow up; she talked about how important it was to stand on your own two feet and be responsible (负责任) for your own acts. For a long time, she talked about honesty and emphasized the fact that when people do something dishonest, they are really cheating themselves. She made me promise that I would think seriously about all the things she had said, and then she told me I could leave. I walked out of the room wondering why she had chosen to talk to me about all those things.
    Later on, I found out that she thought I had cheated on the test. When she saw me lean over to talk to the girl next to me, it looked as if I was copying answers from the girl’s test paper. I tried to explain about the pen, but all she could say was it seemed very very strange to her that I hadn’t talked of anything about the pen the day she talked to me right after the test. Even if I tried to explain that I was just doing the girl a favor by letting her use my pen, I am sure she continued to believe that I had cheated on the test.

    To be a good teacher, you need some of the gifts of a good actor; you must be able to hold the attention and interest of your audience; you must be a clear speaker, with a good, strong, pleasing voice which is fully under your control; and you must be able to act what you are teaching, in order to make its meaning clear.
    Watch a good teacher, and you will see that he does not sit still before his class： he stands the whole time he is teaching; he walks about, using his arms, hands and fingers to help him in his explanations, and his face to express feelings. Listen to him, and you will hear the loudness, the quality (音色) and the musical note of his voice always changing according to what he is talking about.
    The fact that a good teacher has some of the gifts of a good actor doesn’t mean that he will indeed be able to act well on the stage, for there are very important differences between the teacher’s work and the actor’s. The actor has to speak words which he has learnt by heart; he has to repeat exactly the same words each time he plays a certain part, even his movements and the ways in which he uses his voice are usually fixed beforehand (预先). What he has to do is to make all these carefully learnt words and actions seem natural on the stage.
    A good teacher works in quite a different way. His audience takes an active part in his play： they ask and answer questions, they obey orders, and if they don’t understand something, they say so. The teacher therefore has to meet the needs of his audience, which is his class. He cannot learn his part by heart, but must invent it as he goes along.
    I have known many teachers who were fine actors in class but were unable to take part in a stage-play because they could not keep strictly to what another had written.
1. What is the text about ?
   A. How to become a good teacher.
   B. What a good teacher should do outside the classroom.
   C. What teachers and actors could learn from each other.
   D. The similarities(相似处) and differences between a teacher’s work and an actor’s.
2. The word “audience” in the fourth paragraph means ____ .
   A. students	B. people who watch a play
   C. people who not on the stage	D. people who listen to something
3. A good teacher ____ .
   A. knows how to hold the interest of his students	B. must have a good voice
   C. knows how to act on the stage	D. stands or sits still while teaching
4. In what way is a teacher’s work different from an actor’s ?
   A. The teacher must learn everything by heart .
   B. He knows how to control his voice better than an actor .
   C. He has to deal with unexpected situations .
   D. He has to use more facial expressions .
5. The main difference between students in class and a theatre audience is that ____.
   A. students can move around in the classroom
   B. students must keep silent while theatre audience needn’t
   C. no memory work is needed for the students
   D. the students must take part in their teachers’ plays
6. Why is it that some good teachers are unable to play well on the stage ?
   A. Nobody has taught them how to act on the stage .
   B. Their audiences are different .
   C. It is impossible for them to do so much memory work .
   D. They are not used to repeating exactly the same words .
7. Which of the following is true ?
   A. Teachers have to learn by heart what they are going to say in class .
   B. A teacher cannot decide beforehand what exactly he is going to say in class .
   C. A teacher must speak louder than an actor .
   D. A teacher must have a better memory than an actor .

    In 1909 an English newspaper offered £ 1,000 to the first man to fly across the English Channel in an aeroplane. Today, modern jets cross it in minutes. But at that time it still seemed a good distance. The race to win the money soon became a race between two men. Both were very colourful.
    One was Louis Bleriot. He owned a factory in France that made motor car lamps. He was already well known as a pilot (飞行员) because he had had accidents several times. Some people laughed at him. One man said, “He may not be the first to fly across the Channel but he will certainly be the first to die in an accident!” But Bleriot was really a good and brave pilot. He also had many good ideas about aeroplane design.
    The other man was Hubert Latham. He was half French and half English. He took up flying when his doctors told him he had only a year to live. “Oh, well,” he said, “if I’ m going to die soon, I think I shall have a dangerous and interesting life now.” Latham was the first to try the flight (飞行) across the Channel. Ten kilometres from the French coast, his plane had some trouble. It fell down into the water and began to sink under the water. A boat reached Latham just in time. He was sitting calmly on the wing and was coolly lighting a cigarette (香烟). Bleriot took off six days later. He flew into some very bad weather and very low cloud. He somehow got to the English side and landed in a farmer’s field. When he did so, a customs (海关) officer rushed up to his plane. Planes have changed since then, but customs officers have not. “Have you anything to declare?” The officer demanded.

   A. in the early 20th century	B. in the 19th century

   B. He was told he could live another year.
   C. His plane had some trouble.
   D. He was saved by a boat when his plane was sinking.
6. Why did the costumes officer rush to the plane?
   A. To see if everything was all right with the plane.
   B. To make sure that the pilot was not hurt.
   C. To ask why the plane had landed in a farmer’s field.
   D. None of the above.
7. “Do you have anything to declare?” means ____ .

    My father, at the death of his father, was six years old, and he grew up without education. He moved from Kentucky to Indiana when I was seven. We reached our new home about the time the state came into the Union. It was a wild area, with many bears and other wild animals still in the woods. I grew up there. There were some so-called schools, but what was required of a teacher never went beyond “reading, writing, and adding.” If a stranger supposed to understand Latin happened to live for a time in the area, he was looked on as wizard (奇才). There was simply nothing to excite a desire for education. Of course, when I grew up, I did not know much. Still, somehow, I could read, write, and add, but that was all. The advance I have now made is on this store of education, which I have picked up under the pressure of necessity.

    The flying fox is not a fox at all. It is an extra large bat that has got a fox’s head, and that feeds on fruit instead of insects (昆虫). Like all bats, flying foxes hang themselves by their toes when at rest, and travel in great crowds when out flying. A group will live in one spot for years. Sometimes several hundred of them occupy (占据) a single tree. As they return to the tree toward sunrise, they quarrel among themselves and fight for the best places until long after daylight.
    Flying foxes have babies once a year, giving birth to only one at a time. At first the mother has to carry the baby on her breast wherever she goes. Later she leaves it hanging up, and brings back food for it to eat. Sometimes a baby bat falls down to the ground and squeaks (尖叫) for help. Then the older ones swoop (俯冲) down and try to pick it up. If they fail to do so, it will die. Often hundreds of dead baby bats can be found lying on the ground at the foot of a tree.
1. The passage tells us that there is no difference between the flying fox and the ordinary bat in______.
   A. their size.                             B. their appearance.
