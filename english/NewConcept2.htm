style='font-family:宋体'>私人谈话</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Last week I went to the theatre. I had a
very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man
and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very
angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the
woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it.
I turned round again. ‘I can't hear a word!’ I said angrily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>‘It's none of your business, ’ the young
man said rudely. ‘This is a private conversation!’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 2&nbsp; Breakfast or lunch?&nbsp;
</span></b><b><span style='font-family:宋体'>早餐还是午餐？</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It was Sunday. I never get up early on
Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up very
late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. </span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>What a day!</span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US> I thought. </span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>It's raining again. </span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US> Just then, the telephone rang.
It was my aunt Lucy. </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span
lang=EN-US>I've just arrived by train, </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span
lang=EN-US> she said. </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>But
I'm still having breakfast, </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>What
are you doing?</span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US> she
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>I'm

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;Lesson 3&nbsp; Please send me a
card&nbsp; </span></b><b><span style='font-family:宋体'>寄张明信片</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Postcards always spoil my holidays. Last
summer, I went to Italy. I visited museums and sat in public gardens. A
friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian. Then he lent me a book. I
read a few lines, but I did not understand a word. Every day I thought about
postcards. My holidays passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my friends.
On the last day I made a big decision. I got up early and bought thirty-seven
cards. I spent the whole day in my room, but I did not write a single card!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 4&nbsp; An exciting trip&nbsp; </span></b><b><span
style='font-family:宋体'>激动人心的旅行</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I have just received a letter from my
brother, Tim. He is in Australia. He has been there for six months. Tim is an
engineer. He is working for a big firm and he has already visited a great
number of different places in Australia. He has just bought an Australian car
and has gone to Alice Springs, a small town in the centre of Australia. He will soon visit Darwin From there, he will fly to Perth. My brother has never
been abroad before, so he is finding this trip very exciting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 5&nbsp; No wrong numbers&nbsp; </span></b><b><span
style='font-family:宋体'>无错号之虞</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mr. James Scott has a garage in Silbury and
now he has just bought another garage in Pinhurst. Pinhurst is only five miles
from Silbury, but Mr. Scott cannot get a telephone for his new garage, so he
has just bought twelve pigeons. Yesterday, a pigeon carried the first message
from Pinburst to Silbury. The bird covered the distance the first three
minutes. Up to now, Mr. Scott has sent a great many requests for spare parts
and other urgent messages from one garage to the other. In this way, he has begun
his own private</span><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>telephone</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 6&nbsp; Percy Buttons&nbsp; </span></b><b><span
style='font-family:宋体'>珀西·巴顿斯</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I have just moved to a house in Bridge Street. Yesterday a beggar knocked at my door. He asked me for a meal and a glass of
beer. In return for this, the beggar stood on his head and sang songs. I gave
him a meal. He ate the food and drank the beer. Then he put a piece of cheese
in his pocket and went away. Later a neighbour told me about him. Everybody
knows him. His name is Percy Buttons. He calls at every house in the street
once a month and always asks for a meal and a glass of &nbsp;beer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 7&nbsp; Too late&nbsp; </span></b><b><span
style='font-family:宋体'>为时太晚</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The plane was late and detectives were
waiting at the airport all morning. They were expecting a valuable parcel of
diamonds from South Africa. A few hours earlier, someone had told the police
that thieves would try to steal the diamonds. When the plane arrived, some of
the detectives were waiting inside the main building while others were waiting
on the airfield. Two men took the parcel off the plane and carried it into the
Customs House. While two detectives were keeping guard at the door, two others
opened the parcel. To their surprise, the precious parcel was full of stones
and sand!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 8&nbsp; The best and the
worst&nbsp; </span></b><b><span style='font-family:宋体'>最好的和最差的</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden
in our town. Nearly everybody enters for</span><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span
lang=EN-US>The Nicest Garden Competition</span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span
lang=EN-US>each year, but Joe wins every time. Bill Frith's garden is larger
than Joe's. Bill works harder than Joe and grows more flowers and vegetables,
but Joe's garden is more interesting. He has made neat paths and has built a
wooden bridge over a pool. I like gardens too, but I do not like hard work.
Every year I enter for the garden competition too, and I always win a little
prize for the worst garden in the town! </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 9&nbsp; A cold welcome&nbsp; </span></b><b><span
style='font-family:宋体'>冷遇</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>On Wednesday evening, we went to the Town
Hall. It was the last day of the year and a large crowd of people had gathered
under the Town Hall clock. It would strike twelve in twenty minutes' time.
Fifteen minutes passed and then, at five to twelve, the clock stopped. The big
minute hand did not move. We waited and waited, but nothing happened. Suddenly
someone shouted, </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>It's
two minutes past twelve! The clock has stopped!’ I looked at my watch. It was
true. The big clock refused to welcome the New Year. At that moment, everybody
began to laugh and sing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 10&nbsp; Not for jazz&nbsp; </span></b><b><span
style='font-family:宋体'>不适于演奏爵士乐</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We have an old musical instrument. It is
called a clavichord. It was made in Germany in 1681. Our clavichord is kept in
the living room. It has belonged to our family for a long time . The instrument
was bought by my grandfather many years ago . Recently it was damaged by a
visitor . She tried to play jazz on it! She struck the keys too hard and two of
the strings were broken. My father was shocked. Now we are not allowed to touch
it . It is being repaired by a friend of my father's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 11&nbsp; One good turn deserves
another&nbsp; </span></b><b><span style='font-family:宋体'>礼尚往来</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I was having dinner at a restaurant when
Tony Steele came in. Tony worked in a lawyer's office years ago, but he is now
working at a bank. He gets a good salary, but he always borrows money from his
friends and never pays it back. Tony saw me and came and sat at the same table.
He has never borrowed money from me. While he was eating, I asked him to lend
me twenty pounds. To my surprise, he gave me the money immediately. </span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>I have never borrowed any money
from you, </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US> Tony
said, </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>so now you
can pay for my dinner!</span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 12&nbsp; Goodbye and good
luck&nbsp; </span></b><b><span style='font-family:宋体'>再见，一路顺风</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Our neighbour, Captain Charles Alison, will
sail from Portsmouth tomorrow. We'll meet him at the harbour early in the
morning. He will be in his small boat, Topsail. Topsail is a famous little
boat. It has sailed across the Atlantic many times. Captain Alison will set out
at eight o'clock, so we'll have plenty of time. We'll see his boat and then
we'll say goodbye to him. He will be away for two months. We are very proud of
him. He will take part in an important race across the Atlantic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 13&nbsp; The Greenwood Boys&nbsp;
</span></b><b><span style='font-family:宋体'>绿林少年</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Greenwood Boys are a group of pop
singers. At present, they are visiting all parts of the country. They will be
arriving here tomorrow. They will be coming by train and most of the young
people in the town will be meeting them at the station. Tomorrow evening they
will be singing at the Workers' Club. The Greenwood Boys will be staying for
five days. During this time, they will give five performances. As usual, the
police will have a difficult time. They will be trying to keep order. It is
always the same on these occasions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 14&nbsp; Do you speak
English?&nbsp; </span></b><b><span style='font-family:宋体'>你会讲英语吗？</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I had an amusing experience last year.
After I had left a small village in the south of France, I drove on to the next
town. On the way, a young man waved to me. I stopped and he asked me for a
lift. As soon as he had got into the car, I said good morning to him&nbsp; in
French and he replied in the same language. Apart from a few words, I do not
know any French at all. Neither of us spoke during the journey. I had nearly
reached the town, when the young man suddenly said, very slowly, </span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>Do you speak English?</span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US>As I soon learnt, he was
English himself!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 15&nbsp; Good news&nbsp; </span></b><b><span
style='font-family:宋体'>佳音</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The secretary told me that Mr. Harmsworth
would see me. I felt very nervous when I went into his office. He did not look
up from his desk when I entered. After I had sat down, he said that business
was very bad. He told me that the firm could not afford to pay such large
salaries. Twenty people had already left. I knew that my turn had come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
Harmsworth, </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US>I said
in a weak voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>Don't
interrupt, </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US>he
said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Then he smiled and told me I would receive
an extra thousand pounds a year!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 16&nbsp; A polite request&nbsp; </span></b><b><span
style='font-family:宋体'>彬彬有礼的要求</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If you park your car in the wrong place, a
traffic policeman will soon find it. You will be very lucky if he lets you go
without a ticket. However, this does not always happen. Traffic police are
sometimes very polite. During a holiday in Sweden, I found this note on my car:</span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>Sir, we welcome you to our
city. This is a</span><span style='font-family:宋体'>“</span><span lang=EN-US>No
Parking</span><span style='font-family:宋体'>”</span><span lang=EN-US>area. You
will enjoy your stay here if you pay attention to our street signs. This note
is only a reminder. </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span
lang=EN-US>If you receive a request like this, you cannot fail to obey it!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 17&nbsp; Always young&nbsp; </span></b><b><span
style='font-family:宋体'>青春常驻</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>My aunt Jennifer is an actress. She must be
at least thirty-five years old. In spite of this, she often appears on the
stage as a young girl. Jennifer will have to take part in a new play soon. This
time, she will be a girl of seventeen. In the play, she must appear in a bright
red dress and long black stockings. Last year in another play, she had to wear
short socks and a bright, orange-coloured dress. If anyone ever asks her how
old she is, she always answers, </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span
lang=EN-US>Darling, it must be terrible to be grown up!</span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 18&nbsp; He often does
this!&nbsp; </span></b><b><span style='font-family:宋体'>他经常干这种事！</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>After I had had lunch at a village pub, I
looked for my bag. I had left it on a chair beside the door and now it wasn't
there! As I was looking for it, the landlord came in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>Did
you have a good meal?</span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span
lang=EN-US>he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>Yes,
thank you, </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US>I
answered, </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>but I
can't pay the bill . I haven't got my bag. </span><span style='font-family:
宋体'>’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The landlord smiled and immediately went
out. In a few minutes he returned with my bag and gave it back to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>I'm
very sorry, </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US>he
said. </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>My dog had
taken it into the garden. He often does this!</span><span style='font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 19&nbsp; Sold out&nbsp; </span></b><b><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The play may begin at any moment, </span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US> I said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>It may
have begun already, </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span
lang=EN-US> Susan answered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I hurried to the ticket office. </span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>May I have two tickets please?</span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US>I asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>I'm
sorry, we've sold out, </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span
lang=EN-US> the girl said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>What a
pity!</span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US>Susan
exclaimed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Just then, a man hurried to the ticket
office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>Can I
return these two tickets?</span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span
lang=EN-US> he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>Certainly,
</span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US> the girl said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I went back to the ticket office at once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>Could
I have those two tickets please?</span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span
lang=EN-US> I asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>Certainly,
</span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US> the girl said, </span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>but they're for next Wednesday's
performance. Do you still want them?</span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>I
might as well have them, </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span
lang=EN-US> I said sadly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 20&nbsp; One man in a boat&nbsp; </span></b><b><span
style='font-family:宋体'>独坐孤舟</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Fishing is my favourite sport. I often fish
for hours without catching anything. But this does not worry me. Some fishermen
are unlucky. Instead of catching fish, they catch old boots and rubbish. I am
even less lucky. I never catch anything ---- not even old boots. After having
spent whole mornings on the river, I always go home with an empty bag. </span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>You must give up fishing!</span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US> my friends say. </span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>It's a waste of time. </span><span
style='font-family:宋体'>’</span><span lang=EN-US> But they don't realize one
important thing. I'm not really interested in fishing. I am only interested in
sitting in a boat and doing nothing at all!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 21&nbsp; Mad or not?&nbsp; </span></b><b><span
style='font-family:宋体'>是不是疯了？</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Aeroplanes are slowly driving me mad. I
live near an airport and passing planes can be heard night and day. The airport
was built years ago, but for some reason it could not be used then. Last year,
however, it came into use. Over a hundred people must have been driven away
from their homes by the noise. I am one of the few people left. Sometimes I
think this house will be knocked down by a passing plane. I have been offered a
large sum of money to go away, but I am determined to stay here. Everybody says
I must be mad and they are probably right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 22&nbsp; A glass envelope&nbsp; </span></b><b><span
style='font-family:宋体'>玻璃信封</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>My daughter, Jane, never dreamed of
receiving a letter from a girl of her own age in Holland. Last year, we were
travelling across the Channel and Jane put a piece of paper with her name and
address on it into a bottle. She threw the bottle into the sea. She never
thought of it again, but ten months later, she received a letter from a girl in
  Holland. Both girls write to each other regularly now. However, they have
decided to use the post office. Letters will cost a little more, but they will
certainly travel faster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 23&nbsp; A new house&nbsp; </span></b><b><span
style='font-family:宋体'>新居</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I had a letter from my sister yesterday.
She lives in Nigeria. In her letter, she said that she would come to England next year. If she comes, she will get a surprise. We are now living in a beautiful
new house in the country. Work on it had begun before my sister left. The house
was completed five months ago. In my letter, I told her that she could stay
with us. The house has many large rooms and there is a lovely garden. It is a
very modern house, so it looks strange to some people. It must be the only
modern house in the district.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lesson 24&nbsp; It could be worse&nbsp; </span></b><b><span
style='font-family:宋体'>不幸中之万幸</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I entered the hotel manager's office and
sat down. I had just lost </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>￡</span><span
lang=EN-US>50&nbsp; and I felt very upset. </span><span style='font-family:
宋体'>‘</span><span lang=EN-US>I left the money in my room, </span><span

but he could do nothing. </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span

The temptation to steal is greater than ever before----especially in large

her. The woman first bought a few small articles. After a little time, she
chose one of the most expensive dresses in the shop and handed it to an
assistant who wrapped it up for her as quickly as possible. Then the woman
simply took the parcel and walked out of the shop without paying. When she was
arrested, the detective found out that the shop assistant was her daughter.The
girl ‘gave’ her mother a tree dress once a week!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A public house which was recently bought by
Mr. Ian Thompson is up for sale. Mr. Thompson is going to sell it because it is
haunted.He told me that he could not go to sleep one night because he heard a

had been blocked by chairs and the furniture had been moved. Though Mr.
Thompson had turned the lights off before he went to bed, they were on in the
morning. He also said that he had found five empty whisky bottles which the
ghost must have drunk the night before. When I suggested that some villagers
must have come in for a free drink, Mr. Thompson shook his head. The villagers

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tired of sleeping on the floor, a young man
in Teheran saved up for years to buy a real bed. For the first time in his
life, he became the proud owner of a bed which had springs and a mattress.
Because the weather was very hot, he carried the bed on to the roof of his
house. He slept very well for the first two nights, but on the third night, a
storm blew up. A gust of wind swept the bed off the roof and sent it crashing
into the courtyard below. The young man did not wake up until the bed had
struck the ground. Although the bed was smashed to pieces, the man was
miraculously unhurt. When he woke up, he was still on the mattress. Glancing at
the bits of wood and metal that lay around him, the man sadly picked up the
mattress and carried it into his house. After he had put it on the floor, he
promptly went to sleep again.</span></p>

snake then wound itself round the wires. When it did so, it sent sparks down to
the ground and these immediately started a fire.</span></p>

heavy rain would not only wash away the soil but would cause serious floods as
well. When the fire had at last been put out, the forest authorities ordered
several tons of a special type of grass seed which would grow quickly. The seed
was sprayed over the ground in huge quantities by aeroplanes. The planes had
been planting seed for nearly a month when it began to rain. By then,
however,in many places the grass had already taken root. In place of the great
trees which had been growing there for centuries, patches of green had begun to
appear in the blackened soil.</span></p>

that it would be possible to build a platform in the centre of the Channel.
This platform would serve as a port and a railway station. The tunnel would be
well-ventilated if tall chimneys were built above sea level. In 1860, a better
plan was put forward by an Englishman, William Low. He suggested that a double
railway tunnel should be built. This would solve the problem of ventilation,for
if a train entered this tunnel, it would draw in fresh air behind it. Forty-two
years later a tunnel was actually begun. If,at the time, the British had not
feared invasion, it would have been completed. The world had to wait almost
another 100&nbsp; years for the Channel Tunnel. It was officially opened on

however, seemed quite sure of himself. When the bull got close to him, he clumsily
stepped aside to let it pass. The crowd broke into cheers and the drunk bowed.

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>When you visit London, one of the first
things you will see is Big Ben, the famous clock which can be heard all over
the world on the B.B.C. If the Houses of Parliament had not been burned down in
1834,the great clock would never have been erected. Big Ben takes its name from
sir Benjamin Hall who was responsible for them making of the clock when the new
Houses of Parliament were being built. It is not only of immense size, but is
extremely accurate as well. Officials from Greenwich Observatory have the clock
checked twicea day. On the B.B.C. you can hear the clock when it is actually
striking because microphones are connected to the clock tower. Big Ben has
rarely gone wrong. Once, however, it failed to give the correct time. A
painter&nbsp; who had been working on the tower hung a pot of paint on one of
the hands and slowed it down!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The great racing driver, Sir Malcolm
Campbell, was the first man to drive at over 300 miles per hour. He set up a
new world record in September 1935 at Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah. Bluebird,
the car he was driving, had been specially built for him. It was over 30 feet in
length and had a 2,500-horsepower engine. Although Campbell reached a speed of
over 304 miles per hour, he had great difficulty in controlling the car because
a tyre burst during the first run. After his attempt, Campbell was disappointed
to learn that his average speed had been 299 miles per hour. However, a few
days later, he was told that a mistake had been made. His average speed had
been 301 miles per hour. Since that time, racing drivers have reached speeds
over 600 mites an hour. Following in his father's footsteps many years later,
Sir Malcolm's son, Donald, also set up a world record. Like his father, he was
driving a car called Bluebird.</span></p>

to shame by a boy who, while playing truant, travelled 1,600 miles.He
hitchhiked to Dover and, towards evening, went into a boat to find somewhere to
sleep. When he woke up next morning, he discovered that the boat had, in the
meantime, travelled to Calais. No one noticed the boy as he crept off .From there,
he hitchhiked to Paris in a lorry. The driver gave him a few biscuits and a cup
of coffee and left him just outside the city. The next car the boy stopped did
not take him into the center of Paris as he hoped it would, but to Perpignan on
the French-Spanish border. There he was picked up by a policeman and sent back
to England by the local authorities. He has surely set up a record for the
thousands of children who dream of evading school.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The mummy of an Egyptian woman who died in
800 B. C . has just had an operation. The mummy is that of Shepenmut who was
once a singer in the Temple of Thebes. As there were strange marks on the X-ray
plates taken of the mummy, doctors have been trying to find out whether the
woman died of a rare disease. The only way to do this was to operate. The
operation, which lasted for over four hours, proved to be very difficult
because of the hard resin which covered the skin. The doctors removed a section
of the mummy and sent it to a laboratory. They also found something which the
X-ray plates did not show: a small wax figure of the god Duamutef. This god which
has the head of a cow was normally placed inside a mummy. The doctors have not
yet decided how the woman died. They feared that the mummy would fall to pieces
when they cut it open, but fortunately this has not happened. The mummy
successfully survived the operation.</span></p>

My friends kept on offering me cigarettes and cigars. They made no effort to

After seven days of this I went to a party. Everybody around me was smoking and
I felt extremely uncomfortable. When my old friend Brian urged me to accept a

the Great Exhibition of 1851. The Crystal Palace was different from all other
buildings in the world, for it was made of iron and glass. It was one of the
biggest buildings of all time and a lot of people from many countries came to
see it. A great many goods were sent to the exhibition from various parts of
the world. There was also a great deal of machinery on display. The most wonderful
piece of machinery on show was Nasmyth's steam hammer. Though in those days,
travelling was not as easy as it is today, steam boats carried thousands of
visitors across the Channel from Europe. On arriving in England, they were
taken to the Crystal Palace by train. There were six million visitors in all,
and the profits from the exhibition were used to build museums and colleges.
Later, the Crystal Palace was moved to South London. It remained one of the
most famous buildings in the world until it was burnt down in 1936.</span></p>

Madagascar. A small fishing boat was carried miles out to sea by the powerful
fish as it pulled on the line. Realizing that this was no ordinary fish, the
fisherman made every effort not to damage it in any way. When it was eventually
brought. to shore, it was found to be over thirteen feet long. It had a head
like a horse, big blue eyes, shining silver skin, and a bright red tail. The
fish, which has since been sent to a museum where it is being examined by a

man as they live at a depth of six hundred feet.</span></p>

are used, vibrations will cause the roof of the mine to collapse. Rescue
workers are therefore drilling a hole on the north side of the mine. They
intend to bring the men up in a special capsule. If there had not been a hard
layer of rock beneath the soil, they would have completed the job in a few
hours. As it is, they have been drilling for sixteen hours and they still have
a long way to go. Meanwhile, a microphone, which was lowered into the mine two
hours ago, has enabled the men to keep in touch with their closest relatives.
Though they are running out of food and drink, the men are cheerful and
confident that they will get out soon. They have been told that rescue
operations are progressing smoothly. If they knew how difficult it was to drill
through the hard rock, they would lose heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>People will do anything to see a free show
---- even if it is a bad one. When the news got round that a comedy show would
be presented at our local cinema by the P. and U. Bird Seed Company, we all
rushed to see it. We had to queue for hours to get in and there must have been
several hundred people present just before the show began. Unfortunately, the
show was one of the dullest we have ever seen. Those who failed to get in need
not have felt disappointed, as many of the artistes who should have appeared
did not come. The only funny things we heard that evening came from the
advertiser at the beginning of the programme. He was obviously very nervous and
for some minutes stood awkwardly before the microphone. As soon as he opened
his mouth, everyone burst out laughing. We all know what the poor man should
have said, but what he actually said was: </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span

gentlemen!</span><span style='font-family:宋体'>’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Fish and chips has always been a favourite
dish in Britain, but as the oceans have been overfished, fish has become more
and more expensive. So it comes as a surprise to learn that giant fish are
terrifying the divers on North Sea oil rigs. Oil rigs have to be repaired&nbsp;
frequently and divers, who often have to work in darkness a hundred feet under
water, have been frightened out of their wits by giant fish bumping into them
as they work. Now they have had special cages made to protect them from these
monsters. The fish are not sharksor killer whales, but favourite eating
varieties like cod and skate which grow to unnatural sizes, sometimes as much
as twelve feet in length. Three factors have caused these fish to grow so
large: the warm water round the hot oil pipes under the sea; the plentiful
supply of food thrown overboard by the crews on the rigs; the total absence of
fishing boats around the oil rigs. As a result, the fish just eat and eat and
grow and grow in the lovely warm water. Who eats who?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A pilot noticed a balloon which seemed to
be making for a Royal Air Force Station nearby. He informed the station at
once, but no one there was able to explain the mystery. The officer in the
control tower was very angry when he heard the news, because balloons can be a
great danger to aircraft. He said that someone might be spying on the station
and the pilot was ordered to keep track of the strange object. The pilot
managed to circle the balloon for some time. He could make out three men in a
basket under it and one of them was holding a pair of binoculars. When the
balloon was over the station, the pilot saw one of the men taking photographs.
Soon afterwards, the balloon began to descend and it landed near an airfield.
The police were called in, but they could not arrest anyone, for the basket
contained two Members of Parliament and the Commanding Officer of the station!
As the Commanding Officer explained later, one half of the station did not know
what the other half was doing!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It must have been about two in the morning
when I returned home. I tried to wake up my wife by ringing the doorbell, but
she was fast asleep, so I got a ladder from the shed in the garden, put it
against the wall, and began climbing towards the bedroom window. I was almost
there when a sarcastic voice below said, </span><span style='font-family:宋体'>‘</span><span

 A noble gift </span></b><b><span style='font-family:宋体'>崇高的礼物</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>One of the most famous monuments in the
world, the Statue of Liberty, was presented to the United States of America in
the nineteenth century by the people of France. The great statue, which was
designed by the sculptor Auguste Bartholdi, took ten years to complete. The
actual figure was made of copper supported by a metal framework which had been
especially constructed by Eiffel. Before it could be transported to the United
States, a site had to be found for it and a pedestal had to be built. The site
chosen was an island at the entrance of New York Harbour. By 1884, a statue
which was 151 feet tall had been erected in Paris. The following year, it was
taken to pieces and sent to America. By the end of October 1886, the statue had
been put together again and it was officially presented to the American people
by Bartholdi. Ever since then, the great monument has been a symbol of liberty
for the millions of people who have passed through New York Harbour to make
their homes in America.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Experiments have proved that children can
be instructed in swimming at a very early age. At a special swimming pool in Los Angeles, children become expert at holding their breath under water even before they
can walk. Babies of two months old do not appear to be reluctant to enter the
water. It is not long before they are so accustomed to swimming that they can
pick up weights from the floor of the pool. A game that is very popular with
these young swimmers is the underwater tricycle race. Tricycles are lined up on
the floor of the pool seven feet under water. The children compete against each
other to reach the other end of the pool. Many pedal their tricycles, but most
of them prefer to push or drag them. Some children can cover the whole length
of the pool without coming up for breath even once. Whether they will ever
become future Olympic champions, only time will tell. Meanwhile, they should
encourage those among us who cannot swim five yards before they are gasping for
air.</span></p>

style='font-family:宋体'>亡灵返乡</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A Festival for the Dead is held once a year
in Japan. This festival is a cheerful occasion, for on this day, the dead are
said to return to their homes and they are welcomed by the living. As they are
expected to be hungry after their long journey, food is laid out for them.
Specially-made lanterns are hung outside each house to help the dead to find
their way. All night long, people dance and sing. In the early morning, the
food that had been laid out for the dead is thrown into a river or into the sea
as it is considered unlucky for anyone living to eat it. In towns that are near
the sea, the tiny lanterns which had been hung in the streets the night before,
are placed into the water when the festival is over. Thousands of lanterns
slowly drift out to sea guiding the dead on their return journey to the other
world. This is a moving spectacle, for crowds of people stand on the shore
watching the lanterns drifting away until they can be seen no more. </span></p>
